	<h2>About</h2>
	<img src="/images/Exhibit.png" alt="Elizabeth James working on an exhibit cabinet layout." class="homeimage">
	<p>You found me! I’m an archivist, researcher, and a few other things besides. I’m interested in a little bit of everything related to archives, technology, and how technology can facilitate access to library and archives resources in both positive and negative ways.</p>
	<p>I'm particularly interested in how technology can help leverage digitized and digital cultural heritage materials to further scholarship, discovery, and use of cultural heritage materials.</p>
	<p>As an archivist in Appalachia, I care about increasing access and decreasing inequity in archives and libraries. If you like those things too, let's talk!</p>
