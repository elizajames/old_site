	<h2>About</h2>
	<img src="/images/Exhibit.png" alt="Elizabeth James working on an exhibit cabinet layout." class="homeimage">
	<p>You found me! I’m an archivist, researcher, and a few other things besides. I’m interested in a little bit of everything related to archives, technology, and how technology can facilitate (and sometimes negatively impact) access to library and archive resources.</p>
	<p>As you might guess, I care a lot about increasing access and decreasing inequity in archives and libraries.</p>
