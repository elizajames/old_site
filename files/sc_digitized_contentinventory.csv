Charles S. Morehead (1802-1868) Charles Slaughter Morehead, governor of Kentucky from 1855 to 1859, was arrested and imprisoned by Union authorities during the Civil War. Although a Southern sympathizer supportive of Kentucky’s neutrality, he worked for a peaceful resolution, hoping to avert war. He was critical of the Lincoln administration, and, in September 1861, Union authorities arrested Morehead. Charged with treason and “stirring up and promoting rebellion,” he was imprisoned in Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor and Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. Several influential Kentuckians asked for Morehead’s freedom. President Lincoln said that if two of his key Kentucky advisors, James Speed and James Guthrie, agreed, Morehead would be released. Guthrie and others concurred, and Morehead left prison in January 1862.

Walker, Battery M. 1 artillery, Sullevans Island, South Carlina Occupied by the Confederates. Repaired and completed on its original plans, Fort Sumter became the Citadel of Charleston Harbor, with a garrison of 550 artillerists, and an armament of about 80 guns. From the attack by DuPont's armored squadron in April, 1863, the Fort suffered little, not enough to change its appearance on the exerrior. But, when in the summer of the same year, the breaching batteries of rifle cannon, directed by Gereral Gillmore, opened on the Fort from Morris Island, assisted by the armored squadron, the demolition of the work was brought about in one week, and the silencing of its guns soon followed. The appearance of the interior of the Fort, after this first bombarddment, is seen in the photo-view presented in the photo. The observer is looking northwardly from the level of the parade towards the salient and its two adjacent faces. On the left, a single gun in barbette is pointed toward the city; the flag staff is seen at the eastern angle of the sea-face, or right flank, opposite Fort Moultrie, while the upper casemates of three side of the Fort, and both the eastern and western barracks are destroyed. The gorge is not seen, being in the fore-ground; its upper part was destroyed, but its mass remained indestructible to the end. No work of repair or refitting had yet been done.",,,"Fort Sumter, September 1863, interior, looking north, after first great bombardment"

The view is not in the least exaggerated; it was taken at the time by a special draughtsman, and shows the increased ruin of the Fort, due to a second great bombardment some few months after the first, and in the end of the year 1863. Some places show the work of repair and remodeling begun, and continued thenceforth almost uninterruptedly, through the fire. The sea-wall is battered down in places to half its original height. The station of the armored squadron is shown off Morris Island, which had then been evacuated by confederates. The shore of Sullivan's Island is seen on the left in the distance.

The flag staff at this angle was frequently shot away, and replaced with distinguished gallantry. The wide and deep cut, made in the crest of the gorge wall, was a much exposed point. The eastern end of the principal bomb-proof is shown with its slanting logs and sand-bags for protection.

To obtain a cross-fire from Fort Sumter with the works on Sullivan's Island, Fort Moultrie and others, three guns were mounted as described in the lowere casemates of Sumter near the eastern angle; but the outer wall having been much shaken and weakened by the naval fire of the attack, resort was had to a crib-work of logs (palmetto) projecting ten feet outside of the wall, filled with debris, and pierced with embrasures for short range firing upon the main channel. Had the armored vessels ever attempted to run past into the harbor, these guns behind their cracked brick wall, strengthened by a palmetto shield, might have done some service; as it happened they were never called into action. The upright irons placed along the water's edge of the sea-front, served the two-fold purpose of retaining other horizontally laid irons for a footing to the slope of tide and storm-washed debris, and of carrying strong iron wires from post to post, in the way of obstruction and entanglement. Evidence of the great loss of material to the fort is shown in the large blocks of masonry fallen from about to the water's edge.",,,"Fort Sumter, March 1864, interior of east battery, with palmetto shield"

As a result of early organizational conventions, Wheeling was selected as the first Mountain State capital. The distance of Wheeling from other parts of the state bothered Charleston residents. In 1869, they offered to build a statehouse at their expense, if the legislature was moved to Charleston. An act was passed and the capital was removed, effective April 1, 1870, by river route to Charleston. The people of Wheeling quickly countered with a similar offer. The legislature forthwith designated Wheeling as the capital, February 20, 1875. Up went the $80,000 Wheeling statehouse and back came the capital. Indignation and protests reverberated throughout Charleston. Charlestonians declared the act unconstitutional and secured an injunction restraining the govenor and state officials from removing any state ardhives or documents. However, Governor Jacob and other state officials left Charleston the the appointed day, May 21, 1875, on board the steamer Emma Graham. For some reason they were transferred at Parkersburg to the Chesapeake (see drawing on reverse side). After considerable litigation the archives arrived three months later. Mounting dissatisfaction toward the capital on steamers became manifest and a referendum was called to end the problem. On August 7, 1877, Mountain State residents were asked to vote for either Charleston, Wheeling, or Martinsburg as their capital. Charleston polled the most votes and was awarded the wandering statehouse, effective May 1, 1885. On May 3, 1885, the Chesapeake returned the capital to Charleston. Since that spring day 82 years ago, except for minor relocations, the capital has remained in Charleston, evincing a marked contrast to the first 22 years of statehood when the West Virginia government was truly a cruising capital.",,,West Virginia's cruising capital

In 1952, the No. 377 retired from service and was intended for scrapping. Around the same time, however, the city of Logan, West Virginia issued a request to the C&O asking for the use of a vintage C&O train which might have resembled the one that arrived in 1904 with the completion of the Logan Branch. The C&O agreed to age the No. 377 by installing an oil headlight, flanged stack, cylinder head stars, wooden pilot and old style paint scheme. After the anniversary celebration, the C&O combined the No. 377 with the ex-Hocking Valley wooden combine, No. 409 for use as a display train.",Charles D.
