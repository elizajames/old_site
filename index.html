	<p>I am Elizabeth James, archivist, librarian, and maker of digital and analog things. I do a little bit of everything: digital preservation, data wrangling, repository management, teaching, furniture moving, student support, and "other duties as assigned".</p>
	<p>I love to collaborate: if you see something you think is interesting or think Iâ€™ll find interesting, please contact me!</p>
