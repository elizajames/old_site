	<p>This is the web page for Elizabeth James, archivist/librarian/????. I do a little bit of everything: digital preservation, data collection and wrangling, repository management, outreach, teaching, furniture moving, student support, and "other duties as assigned". Sometimes, as a treat, I even manage to sneak some actual collection processing time in there.</p>
	<p>Here, you’ll find a collation of some projects I’ve done, things I’ve written, and soon some random musings on the aptly titled “Blog?” page.</p>
	<p>I love to collaborate: if you see something you think is interesting or think I’ll find interesting, please contact me!</p>
