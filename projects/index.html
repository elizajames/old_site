	<h3>Visualizing Francis Pierpont's Telegram Network</h3>
	<p>This project visualized the communication and geospatial network of individuals who sent telegrams to Francis Pierpont, first governor of West Virginia, during the Civil War. These 850 telegrams were digitized by West Virginia University in 2011 and included granular transcriptions of the sender name, sender location, recipient, recipient location, message sent, and date. These metadata components make it possible for researchers to easily work with the telegrams as data. First, however, I had to get that data. WVU uses a content management system that creates a stable and iterative numerical URI for each digitized item but did not have an API through which to get that data. I wrote code in Python that allowed me to automate the scraping of metadata from each page. Cleaning the data involved some manual labor because locations were transcribed as written, including temporary camp locations that are no longer extant, rather than mapped to specific locations or coordinates in the present day. I then used additional automated tools to get coordinates for each location based on the newly standardized location names.</p>
	<p>Initially, I chose to visualize this data set with TimeMapper, which allows individuals to interact with the information geospatially and temporally. However, I found this approach was inadequate because the frequency of telegrams sent from a particular location was not visualized, making it difficult for the viewer to understand which locations or individuals Pierpont corresponded with most frequently. Additionally, I felt that the network of communicants was not adequately visualized by isolated pins alone. However, I do feel that TimeMapper is a good tool for those who wish to emphasize discovery of the content in the collection over time and space.</p>

	<p>I chose to move this data to Palladio, which allowed me to better visualize the frequency of telegrams sent as well as the network of individuals who sent these telegrams. Creating a network of senders and sender locations (second image below) allowed me to notice connections between various individuals who existed in the same time and space in a way that was nearly impossible when viewing the telegrams as discrete items.</p>
	<h3>Mapping Looking at Appalachia</h3>
	<p>I have admired the work of Roger May for a long time, and when he put out a call on Twitter for help mapping the Looking at Appalachia project, I had no choice but to respond. The Looking at Appalachia project is composed of more than 800 photos contributed from individuals throughout the Appalachian region to demonstrate the diversity and complexity of the Appalachian experience. On the project website, the photos are housed in an image carousel and organized by state of origin and feature only plain text unstandardized metadata about each photo. I wrote a Python program to visit the page for each state and crawl the page for the URL and string of metadata associated with each of the images. Then, I used regular expressions to parse out data for the photographer, date, URL, and location of each photograph. Because this data was not created by a cataloger or other metadata expert, some manual and automated cleanup was needed in Excel to clean and map locations to federal county FIPS codes. Specifically, Virginia has some unique geographic entities that are independent cities within counties that defied standardized methods. Then, the data was imported into Datawrapper for visualization and dissemination purposes.</p>
	<p>Creating this map allowed me to help Roger more concretely see what areas of Appalachia are more represented by the project and help determine what areas could benefit from outreach. Additionally, this map helps demonstrate that Looking at Appalachia depicts a broad geographic range of Appalachian experiences.</p>

	<h3>Exploring the Southern Courier (In Progress)</h3>
	<p><i>The Southern Courier</i> was a newspaper published out of Montgomery, Alabama during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement. All 177 issues of <i>The Southern Courier</i> are digitized and available online but are not full text searchable. To complement this valuable collection, the staff photographer for the newspaper, Jim Peppler, donated 13,000 negatives to the Alabama Department of Archives and History. The latter collection is fully digitized and features full and rich metadata for each photograph using standardized vocabularies, making it perfect for usage in data visualizations or analyses.</p>
	<p>Putting large numbers of photos in a content management system and asking users to input keywords isn’t the most ideal. I am working on this project to explore how cultural heritage institutions can make it easier for users to explore and enjoy digital materials recreationally rather than for a specific purpose. For this project, I’m especially interested in determining how treating digital collection items as data can allow for improved discovery of content by non-academics and ultimately enhance the use of these two unique collections.</p>

	<h3>Vietnam Veteran Oral Histories as Data</h3>
	<p>While working with large humanistic data sets can create more broadly applicable scholarship, working with small sets of data in one-shot instruction sessions can help students begin to understand the value of working computationally with materials that are traditionally not viewed through a computational lens. For instance, when viewing the interrelated subject data associated with thirty-two oral histories by Vietnam veterans, students can visibly see the significant overlap in content discussed by veterans and identify broader themes. Using Palladio to visualize the overlap in content makes it possible for students to discover and compare oral histories that focus these themes, ultimately creating higher quality scholarship. The visualization below was used in a session of a First Year Seminar course that focused on analyzing propaganda in the Vietnam War as a way of fostering critical thinking and information literacy skills.</p>
